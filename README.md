ClaferMoo Visualizer is a web-based application. Its server side (implemented with Node.JS) only runs ClaferMoo and passes back its output.
The client-side is implemented using Javascript/HTML and handles all the basic functionality.

Installation
--------------------

A special installation procedure is not required. Modified ClaferMoo version is on the package.

### Dependencies for running

* Dependencies for [ClaferMoo](https://github.com/gsdlab/claferMooStandalone) must be satisfied *
* [Node.JS Framework](http://nodejs.org/dist/), the stable version "0.2.4". Exactly this version should be installed, since the tool has not been tested in other versions, but the newest one may not work *

On Windows only

* [Installation procedure of Node.JS](http://www.lucashills.com/articles/3) for Windows is shown here.
  
### Preliminary settings

1. Make sure the port 8080 is free, or change the variable value in server.js:
  var port = 8080;
to any free one. This would be brought to the configuration settings file later.

2. Make sure *clafer*, *python* and *java* are in PATH environment variables, so they can be executed without any path prefixes.

3. Make sure *uploads* folder is accessible for writing, since temporary files will be stored there.

4. Alloy solutions XML files are stored in the root, it is not fixed yet, so make sure the root folder is also writeable.

### Running

Go to the browser and type "http://localhost:[port]/". Then open any Clafer file with objectives in it.
